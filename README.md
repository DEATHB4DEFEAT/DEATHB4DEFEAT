# About me
> ### Hello! I am DEATHB4DEFEAT#4404, but I prefer being called Death.
>
> I am the lead developer for [Parkstation](https://github.com/Park-station/Parkstation), a fork of [Nyanotrasen](https://github.com/Nyanotrasen/Nyanotrasen), which is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14).
>
> **Space Station 14** (SS14 for short) is a community driven project to get the open source game [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com) into a new engine and free from its current engine, [BYOND](https://secure.byond.com). BYOND is an incredibly dated engine, and is not cutting it. It’s a pain to develop for, slow, proprietary, and looks like it’s from 2005. Along with this we will try to make the game more enjoyable all around, such as pixel movement and a consistent style.
>
> Originally, the SS14 project was a continuation of [Goonstation](https://forum.ss13.co)’s remake attempt, which was abandoned and [open sourced on 19 of January, 2015](https://archive.fo/xey2L).
> Space Station 14 has been built from the ground to be fast, modular, cross-platform, as well as fully moddable and extendable. Anyone can add basic items or variations to the game via the easily accessible YAML prototype system, and with some knowledge of C#, add or modify even core functionalities and systems.
